description: Summarize current session - shows files changed, tools used, errors
---

Analyze this session and provide a summary of:
1. What files were modified, created, or read
2. Which tools were used most
3. Any errors encountered
4. What should be preserved vs discarded if compacting

This helps before running /compact to understand what context is worth keeping.
